# Papyrus Frontend (TS + React + Arco)

## Stack

- TypeScript
- React 19.x
- Arco Design React (`@arco-design/web-react`)
- Vite

## React 19 adapter

This project uses React 19 and **must** include Arco's adapter before importing Arco components:

```ts
import '@arco-design/web-react/es/_util/react-19-adapter';
```

See: `frontend/src/main.tsx`.

## Local development

Install dependencies:

```bash
cd frontend
npm i
```

Start dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Default URL: http://127.0.0.1:5173

## Backend API (reserved)

Backend communication is planned via FastAPI under `/api/*`.

During development you can proxy it from Vite (see `frontend/vite.config.js`).
