# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- MCP Extension API for third-party integrations
- Markdown rendering API endpoint
- Web clipper browser extension support
- Daily note automation

### Changed
- Improved note editor with Obsidian-style edit/preview dual mode
- Enhanced markdown rendering with markdown-it

### Fixed
- PyInstaller 6.x compatibility issues
- Windows build strip command warnings
- Asset duplication in build

### Security
- Bumped frontend `lodash` to ≥4.18.1 and `postcss` to ≥8.5.10 via `npm audit fix`
- Production dependency audit (`npm audit --omit=dev --audit-level=high`) is now enforced in CI; both frontend and backend ship with zero high/critical advisories
- Known dev-chain advisories remain in `vite`/`esbuild` (dev server only) and `tar` via `electron-builder` (build-host only); these do not affect the released binary and are not gated by the prod-only audit
