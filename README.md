# 📜 Papyrus

**English** · [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md) · [日本語](README.ja.md)

> ⚠️ **Preview README** — this version describes the upcoming **`v2.0.0`** (TypeScript / Fastify backend). The code currently on `main` is still the legacy Python build. This README ships ahead of the backend rewrite via PR — feature mentions and install instructions will only apply once the backend rewrite lands on `main`.

**Papyrus** is a minimalist, keyboard-driven, AI-agent-powered spaced-repetition (SRS) review engine, designed for high-intensity memory drilling.

> *"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication."*

---

## ✨ Highlights

- 🚀 **Flow-state interaction** — fully keyboard-driven; never touch the mouse during a review session.
- 🧠 **Proven scheduling** — built-in SM-2 spaced-repetition algorithm tunes the next review interval per card.
- 🤖 **AI agent** — OpenAI / Anthropic / Ollama, with tool-call approval flow (manual or auto-approve) and call history.
- 📝 **Notes + Obsidian import** — bring your existing vault, navigate via folder tree, tags, and a relation graph.
- 🕘 **Version history & rollback** — every note/card edit auto-saves a content-hashed version; rollback creates a forward version (no destructive history).
- 🔐 **Encrypted API keys at rest** — AES-GCM with a per-install master key, salt, and auth tag.
- 🛡️ **Hardened defaults** — auth token required for write APIs, SSRF guard for AI base URLs, rate limiting on the public surface, path-traversal protection (`dev`+`ino` containment).
- ♿ **Accessibility** — WCAG 2.1 AA across the app, with AAA-grade contrast options, screen-reader optimization, and reduced-motion modes.
- 🌐 **Modern stack** — Node.js + TypeScript (Fastify) backend, React 19 + Vite + Arco Design frontend, Electron 41 shell.
- 📦 **Local-first** — your data never leaves the machine unless you point an AI provider at the cloud.

## 📥 Download

Pre-built installers are published on the [Releases](https://github.com/PapyrusOR/Papyrus_Desktop/releases) page.

| Platform | Architecture | Formats |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Windows | x64 | NSIS installer (`.exe`), Portable (`.exe`) |
| macOS | arm64 | DMG (`.dmg`), ZIP (`.zip`) |
| Linux | x64 | AppImage, DEB (`.deb`), TAR.GZ |

> ⚠️ `v2.0.0-beta` is a beta. The data schema is stable, but the UI and APIs may still evolve before `v2.0.0`.

## ⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts (Flow Mode)

| Key | Action | Effect |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Space** | Reveal answer | Unrolls the scroll, showing the answer side |
| **1** | Forgot | Mark unfamiliar; the card returns soon |
| **2** | Hazy | Mark uncertain; the card returns later today |
| **3** | Aced | Memory rock-solid; interval doubles linearly |
| **Tab** | Navigate | Move focus between interactive elements |
| **Ctrl + K** | Search | Open the global search palette |

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (from source)

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 24+
- **npm** 11+

### Install

```bash
# postinstall cascades into frontend/ and backend/
npm install
```

### Run in dev mode

```bash
# Concurrently runs backend (Fastify, tsx watch) + frontend (Vite)
npm run dev

# Or, with the Electron shell on top
npm run electron:dev
```

- Frontend: <http://localhost:5173>
- Backend API: <http://127.0.0.1:8000>
- Health check: <http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/health>

### Build installers

```bash
npm run electron:build          # current platform
npm run electron:build:win      # Windows only
npm run electron:build:mac      # macOS only
npm run electron:build:linux    # Linux only
```

Installers are emitted to `dist-electron/`.

---

## 📥 Bulk Card Import

Prepare a UTF-8 `.txt` file in this format:

```text
Question or scenario A === Trigger or answer A

Question or scenario B === Trigger or answer B
```

> Cards within a group are separated by `===`. Leave a blank line between groups for readability.

---

## 🤖 AI Configuration

### 1. Configure a provider

Open the in-app **⚙️ Settings** sidebar and add an API key:

- **OpenAI** — get a key at <https://platform.openai.com/api-keys>
- **Anthropic** — get a key at <https://console.anthropic.com/>
- **Ollama** — runs locally, no API key needed
  ```bash
  # Install: https://ollama.ai
  ollama pull llama2
  ```

API keys are persisted **encrypted at rest** (AES-GCM with a per-install master key).

### 2. Pick a mode

- **Agent mode** — the model can invoke tools (add / edit / delete cards, search notes, …) under a tool-call approval flow.
- **Chat mode** — pure conversation, no side effects.

### 3. Tune

- **Temperature** — 0 to 2, higher is more random.
- **Max tokens** — cap on response length.
- **Tool approval** — `manual` (queue and review) or `auto` (allow-list driven).

---

## ♿ Accessibility

Papyrus aims to be usable by everyone:

- **Keyboard navigation** — full Tab traversal across every page.
- **Screen readers** — semantic ARIA labels, live regions for state changes.
- **Contrast** — AAA-grade palettes available under **Settings → Accessibility**.
- **Motion** — reduced-motion mode honors OS preference.

## 🔧 Development

### Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm run dev         # tsx watch — hot-reload Fastify
npm run build       # compile TypeScript to dist/
npm run typecheck   # tsc --noEmit
npm test            # Jest unit + integration
npm start           # run compiled dist/api/server.js
```

The backend listens on `127.0.0.1:8000` by default; override with `PAPYRUS_PORT`.

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev         # Vite dev server (http://localhost:5173)
npm run build       # production build to dist/
npm run typecheck   # TypeScript type-checking
```

### Release flow

```bash
# 1. Move [Unreleased] entries in CHANGELOG.md under the new version

# 2. (optional) preview the section that will land in the GitHub Release
node scripts/extract-changelog.js v2.0.0

# 3. Commit
git add CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "chore: release v2.0.0"

# 4. Tag & push — GitHub Actions builds all three platforms,
#    extracts the matching CHANGELOG section, and uploads installers.
git tag v2.0.0
git push origin main --tags
```

## 📁 Data Files

By default, user data lives under `paths.dataDir` (defaults to `$HOME/PapyrusData`, override with `PAPYRUS_DATA_DIR`):

- `ai_config.json` — provider, model, encrypted API keys
- `Papyrusdata.json` — cards & SM-2 review state
- `notes.json` — notes
- `~/.papyrus/auth.token` — token required for write APIs (generated on first run)

---

## ⚠️ Notes

1. **API costs** — OpenAI and Anthropic bill per use; set provider-side budgets.
2. **Local models** — Ollama is free but needs decent hardware.
3. **Network** — cloud providers need a stable connection.
4. **Privacy** — local models stay local; cloud providers see the prompts you send.
5. **Concurrency** — JSON-file storage is single-writer; don't run multiple instances against the same data dir.

## 💡 A Word from the Author

Honestly, the birth of this project wasn't all that grand or visionary.

Why did I make it? One day I was drilling some AI material and downloaded Anki to memorize the key points. Right after install, the thing wanted to check for updates, the updates wanted to talk to a server, and I just could not get a connection through.

Gemini was sitting right there. So I told it to write me one. We tinkered, I patched, and I started using it.

I never planned to publish it. So why did I?

Yesterday I logged into a long-dormant account to give my girlfriend a star, and GitHub flagged me as a bot and wiped my activity. I was furious. I'm using AI; I'm not AI. To prove I'm not a bot, I cleaned up what I had on hand and put it up here.

End of small story. It's already the sixth day of the lunar new year, and dawn is creeping up. A grumbling student, sighing at three in the morning. Such is life.

There's a phrase I love: **Veritas vos liberabit** — "the truth shall set you free." May we all share in it. This is my first open-source project; please be kind.

Consider this my belated lunar new-year greeting.
**May the new year find you wielding the blade of knowledge — slicing through the void of night, charging straight into the dawn.**
